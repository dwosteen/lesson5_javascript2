### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Nested if functions were utilized in order to calculate the stacking percentages used in tax calculations
2. Used document.getElementById( in order to clear superfluous information from final web page
3. The planning stage was very important in this assignment as it involved several similar functions with differences only in the assigned values, without proper planning syntax errors would be likely.
